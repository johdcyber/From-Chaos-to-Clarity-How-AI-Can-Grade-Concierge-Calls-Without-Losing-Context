Agent: Hello, thanks for calling. How can I help today?
Customer: I want to book a weekend trip and I need flexible options.
Agent: Absolutely. We can explore options. First, what dates were you thinking?
Customer: The 18th through the 20th. I may need to cancel if work calls.
Agent: Got it. I’ll check availability and some upgrade possibilities.
Customer: Please don't promise anything you can't guarantee.
Agent: Understood. We have some properties with potential upgrades pending inventory.
Customer: Okay, what about cancellation policies?
Agent: I'll confirm the policy specifics for each option.
Customer: Great, let's proceed.
... (conversation continues for a long time) ...
Agent: Before we finish, a quick disclosure: upgrades are **not guaranteed** and depend on availability at check‑in. Cancellation fees may apply per the property policy.
Customer: Thanks for clarifying.
Agent: My pleasure. Anything else I can do?
Customer: That's it. Goodbye.
